you washed your feet in the ocean they never came clean
i picked some sand up in my hand to watch it all leave
the wrecking ball did fall you kissed me on the mouth
we rolled around in your sandy bed until i finally snuck out
we lost a lot in the hurricane that came
till everything came back again
floating in, floating in, floating in, floating in....
