Amongst the tires and broken trees, 
all washed up on rubble beach. 
You were the best lover I never loved, 
tucked beneath the seaweed sheets. 
Little scraps of shells and sand caked around your shaky hand, 
as the little fingertips slide inside my belt loop again. 
Your matted hair and sappy stair lost inside the haze of the sun, 
stumbling in a three legged race, 
you lean on me the whole way back home. 
You can never guess what you find washed up on a shore, 
on the sunny day after a storm. 

I left her there in bed that day, 
to watch a hotel hauled away on the back of trucks. 
Among stacks of bricks, lithographs of seaside scenes 
flap in the breeze the canvas ripped. 
I guess I'm scared to wake up next to her 
or maybe I'm too scared to ever fall asleep. 
Comfortably coiled in a tide pool at the edge of the beach 
I watch the world wake up as the sun leaves a land of the stucco bleached, 
my stomach rocks with waves, a smile is tossed on my face, 
cement feet drag me neck deep, sometimes a bit of trouble is great.
